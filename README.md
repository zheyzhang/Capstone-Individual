# Capstone-Individual
 This is copy of what I've done from the group repo. Followed are the tasks I was assigned:
## Data Acquisition
At the first stage, I need to combine the weather data from Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) with 
Energy Demand from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and extract data from Weather Underground (WU).
## Explore Data Analysis (EDA)
After gaining the data, I need to do explore data analysis on the WU data to have a brief look 
and try to find the relation between energy demand with other weather data.
## Modelling
In the modelling phase, I am assigned to do machine learning models based on the data after feature engineering,
thus I chose decision tree regression and random forest for further improve of the prediction accuracy.


The code and modify history may have a little difference with the group repo for better display some plots in the individual report. 
Besides, with time goes, to show the prediction result, it requires the latest forecast climate data, which needs running the 'fetch_code.py' every time,
this code was originally from Nauful, one of my group teammates.
