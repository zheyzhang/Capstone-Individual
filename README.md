This is copy of what I've done from the group repo. 

The contents and modify history may have a little difference for this one includes almost all the work I did for the project, and the group repo
only includes the most relative and important contents. In addition, to make my personal reports more readable and intuitive, I have updated my code
to show more visual content.Last but not least, with time goes, to show the prediction result, it requires the latest forecast climate data, which needs 
running the 'fetch_code.py' every time, and this code was originally from Nauful, one of my group teammates and for the used data in my repo, some of them
are modified by my group teammates, not originally.

Followed are the tasks I was assigned:

## Data Acquisition

At the first stage, I need to combine the weather data from Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) with 
Energy Demand from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and extract data from Weather Underground (WU).

## Explore Data Analysis (EDA)

After gaining the data, I need to do explore data analysis on the WU data to have a brief look 
and try to find the relation between energy demand with other weather data.

## Modelling

In the modelling phase, I am assigned to do machine learning models based on the data after feature engineering,
thus I chose decision tree regression and random forest for further improve of the prediction accuracy.

## Forecast

After choosing the better of the two models, tests are carried out on predicted future climate data to obtain a forecast 
of energy consumption for the next 48 hours or a maximum of 14 days.

## Explanable

The decision tree is a white box model and has a good interpretability, 
whereas the random forest is a black box model and therefore needs to be explained using an explanatory model.
